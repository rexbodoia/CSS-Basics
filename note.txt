  Required. Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document

Q: instead of using class to change style of a specific element,
can we address elements by its id inside of a css file
  it is possible


add external stylesheet, note the rel="stylesheet"
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css_reset.css" type="text/css"/>

reason to use class in css
  1. give style change to a specific element
  2. take priority over other styles

    width: 100px;
  }

  ul li a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit;
  }
